Overview
=========

Welcom to the Marktplaats API documentation. The Marktplaats API is the official
API for Marktplaats. Most of the functionality exposed by the API can be done using
the website, but the API also provides access to features which are not exposed
on the website.

The documentation consists of user guides on how to accomplish certain tasks using
the API. There is also reference documentation available at https://api.marktplaats.nl/docs/v1.

Almost all the API calls on the Marktplaats API have to be :ref:`Authenticated <authentication>`.

.. IMPORTANT::
  In order to authenticate, you need to register your application at Marktplaats. At the moment,
  there is no automated procedure for that. In order to register your application, please contact
  Marktplaats.
